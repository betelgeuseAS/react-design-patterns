### Render Props Pattern

In the Render Props design pattern, a component is structured to accept a function that produces a React Element as one of its props. Rather than relying on its own fixed rendering logic, the component invokes this provided function to determine what content to display.

This approach allows for more flexibility as it avoids embedding specific rendering instructions within each component, offering a dynamic and customizable way to determine how the content should be presented.

To understand this better, imagine we have a collection of products that should be displayed in multiple locations of our application.
While the user interface may vary across these sections, the underlying process remains consistent: fetching the products from the API and presenting the list on the screen.
