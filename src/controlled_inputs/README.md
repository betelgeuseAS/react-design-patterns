Controlled Inputs

The Controlled Input pattern can be used to handle input fields. This pattern involves using an event handler to update the component state if the value of an input field changes, as well as storing the current value of the input field in the component state.

Because React controls the state and behavior of the component, this pattern makes code more predictable and readable than the uncontrolled inputs pattern, which does not use the component's state and instead controls it directly through the DOM (Document object model).
