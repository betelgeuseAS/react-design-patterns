### State Reducer Pattern

Most often, handling many states in a component leads to issues with many ungrouped states, which can be burdensome and challenging to handle. The reducer pattern can be a helpful option in this situation. We can categorize states using reducers into certain actions that, when executed, can change the grouped states.

This pattern allows the developer who uses it to control the component's and/or hook's state management, letting them manage state changes when events are sent.
