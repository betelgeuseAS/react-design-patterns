### Component Compound Pattern

The Compound Components Pattern is a React design pattern for managing parent components that are made up of child components.

The principle behind this pattern is to break down the parent component into smaller components and then manage the interactions between these smaller components with either props, context or other react data management techniques.

This pattern comes in handy when there is a need to create reusable, versatile components made up of smaller components. It enables developers to create sophisticated UI components that can be readily customized and extended while maintaining a clear and simple code structure.
