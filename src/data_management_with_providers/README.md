### Provider Pattern (Data management with Providers)

The provider pattern is very useful for data management as it utilizes the context API to pass data through the application's component tree. This pattern is an effective solution to prop drilling, which has been a common concern in react development.

To implement the provider pattern, we will first create a Provider Component. A Provider is a higher-order component that the Context object provides to us. We can construct a Context object by utilizing the createContext method provided by React.
